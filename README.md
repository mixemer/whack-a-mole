# whack-a-mole

a class project to develop a whack a mole game in javascript with a team of around 15 people divided into 4 groups (backbone, graphics, QA and specs).

I added a timer function on the js program to show the players how many times they have left.

Created a home page. The home page will show the group number and the members in the group (I haven't code the member list yet). I also created a class logo online just to make the website look somewhat fancy. On the top right we have home, game, bug, specs. Right now I only link the game. In the future bug and specs will have their own page. Bug will display the bugs found on the game by the QA. Specs page will be for the specs team.
On the game page (the whack a professor). I created tiny line that says "click this to go back to home", that line if you press on it will send you back to the home page.
Beside software stuff, I organize the the image and audio into a specific folders.
