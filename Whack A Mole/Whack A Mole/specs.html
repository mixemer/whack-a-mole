        <h2>2 Overall Description</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Product Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Whack-a-Prof is a standalone software that is a variation on the traditional
            Whack-a-Mole game. The game is intended to run on any web browser that supports
            Javascript. The game is in a 3 by 3 grid arrangement where the Professor will
            pop up on the screens in which the user will then have to click on the Professor
            to “whack” him.
            <br><br>
            The Player has only 20 seconds to get as high of a score as possible with the mallet which the Player controls with the mouse.<br>
            The Professor pops up randomly and the score counter increases by 10 points when
            the Professor is hit. <br>
